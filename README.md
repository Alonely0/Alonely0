### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student and I love everything related to computers (except debugging, bruh). I'm a Linux enthusiast and I love maths, and I'm always trying to learn about of everything. I used to develop stuff in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python, much of that never saw the light of the sun, but I moved to Rust and created something that is worth it, [Voila](https://github.com/Alonely0/Voila).

Right now, I'm working on [TPR](https://github.com/Alonely0/tpr), a decentralized and anonymous routing protocol which does not require encrypting for protecting the data in transit. The paper is public on my GH, and the code will be available as soon as I finish it. The latest thing I published about it was [Lariv](https://github.com/Alonely0/Lariv), the proof-of-concept data structure for the server in-memory database.
