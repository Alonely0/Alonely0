### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student and I love everything related to computers (except debugging, bruh). I'm a Linux enthusiast, and I love maths and physics, I'm always trying to learn more about of everything. I used to develop stuff in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python, but most of those projects never got to see the light of the sun. However, when I moved to Rust, not only did I become passionate about low-level stuff and systems programming, but I started creating things that are actually worth it.

Right now, I'm working on [TPR](https://github.com/Alonely0/tpr), a decentralized, anonymous and resilient routing protocol which does not require encrypting for protecting the data in transit. The paper is public on my GH, and the code will be available as soon as I finish it. The latest thing I published about it was [Lariv](https://github.com/Alonely0/Lariv), the proof-of-concept data structure for the server in-memory database, which consistently outperforms similar projects (at least for its intended use-case).
